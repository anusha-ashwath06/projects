Fake News Detection using NLP
Introduction
Welcome to the Fake News Detection project as part of the IBM AI Course AI101 for Naanmudhalvan. This project aims to develop a fake news detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to build a model that can distinguish between fake and real news articles.

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: Fake and Real News Dataset. It contains a collection of news articles labeled as either "fake" or "real," making it suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models.

Project Overview
Objectives
Implement NLP techniques to preprocess and analyze text data.
Build and evaluate machine learning models for fake news detection.
Explore the use of LSTM and BERT-based models for improved accuracy.
Create an ensemble model that combines the strengths of different architectures.
Provide a robust fake news detection system that can be used as a valuable tool for media literacy.

Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data, including tokenization and feature engineering.
LSTM Model: Implement a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for fake news detection.
BERT Model: Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for text classification.
Ensemble Model: Create an ensemble model that combines predictions from multiple models.
Evaluation: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and analyze their performance.
Deployment: If required, deploy the best-performing model for practical use.

Machine Learning Algorithms Used
The project uses the following machine learning algorithms and techniques:

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Used for text feature extraction to convert text data into numerical form.
Multinomial Naive Bayes: A classification algorithm for text data often used for spam and fake news detection.
Logistic Regression: A classification algorithm for binary and multi-class classification tasks.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning method for classification and regression tasks.
Passive Aggressive Classifier: A type of online learning algorithm for text classification.

Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Metrics for evaluating the performance of classification models.
ROC Curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic): Used to assess the performance of binary classification models.
Stopwords Removal: A text preprocessing technique to remove common words that do not contribute much information.
Lowercasing: Converting text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
Tokenization: Breaking text into words or tokens for analysis.
